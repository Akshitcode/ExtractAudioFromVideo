# ExtractAudioFromVideo


This is a android application I've created using Android Studio using Java and XML language and database used is SQLite.


In this we basically extract audio from a video by selecting a video from user device and extract the audio from that particular video and save on the device. Also shows all the audio files created and we can also share the audio files and delete them from the device.
